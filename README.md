# Simple-Eletric-Piano
It's final project for 111-2 NCNU CSIE "Microcomputer System Lab"

## What I did
I have implemented a simple electric piano , capable of playing music. Self-customizable function keys that can be recorded into the eXpanded RAM of the MPC82G516, playing back N notes (including pitch and beat). Use of two timers: one for calculating the playback time of notes, and the other for generating the frequency needed for each note.

Main Components:
MCU(MPC82G516A), IC Programmer, Mini Speaker, 7-segment display, 4x4 Keypad, Breadboard
